# Isotropy-and-Homogeneity-in-expanding-2D-spaces
Graphical examples of expanding universes that satisfy homogeneity and isotropy and others that do not (cosmological principle conditions illustration).
Imagine that each red dot represents a stellar cumulus. The different GIFs show how they would evolve respect to the others in distint spaces (homogeneous, isotropic, inhomogeneous and anisotropic). This is useful to illustrate in a simple way the implications of the cosmological principle.

The process to create the GIFs has 3 steps:
1. Create the images: indicate the disposition of the red dots and apply different zooms.
2. Save the images and indicate the ones that you want to use for the creation of the GIF.
3. Create the GIF.
